Here is the base code for the Monster Dash project.  The Makefile should be
sufficient to outline where things are but here's a high-level overview:

* inc/       : Include directory for all the game related include files
* obj/       : Directory where object files are stored
* src/       : Directory for all the game related source files
* Monster/   : Directory for all the monster related files (source and include)
* Player/    : Directory for all the player related files (source and include)
* Playfields : Directory for the playfields.
* Makefile   : Makefile for the project

There are two build targets defined in the makefile:

   * make
   * make debug

Which will do the expected things.

To run the program, compile and run specifying the playfield to use:

make
main Playfields/A.in

You can add an optional commandline parameter which will introduce a delay
between turns so that the monster and player behavior can be better viewed.

main Playfields/B.in 1000

The delay parameter is specified in terms of milliseconds.

The game code is set up to run lots of head-to-head trials so the output is
formatted to be parsable.  After a run the results message will be written to
a file named ResultsFile.txt.  You may want to change those messages for
development purposes but do not change exposed interfaces in the game code
(site, game, playfield, util, callbacks, etc.)

The code for your monster and player should all reside in the Monster and
Player directories (respectively).  The tournament is run by grabbing a monster
and a player implementation, adding the common game code, compiling and running
against one or more Playfields.  If you have multiple player/monsters, you
can easily change the Makefile to accommodate that.
